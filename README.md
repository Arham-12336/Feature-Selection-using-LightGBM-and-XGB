# Gradient-Boosting Algorithm 📊
👨‍💻 This repository contains code for evaluating various machine learning models for binary classification.

## Features Selection 🧐
🔍 Features used for the models are selected through the Feature Importance method using Random Forest.

## Data Import 📈
The dataset is loaded from "FMat.pkl", and features are extracted for training and testing.

## Data Preprocessing 🔄
Categorical data is encoded using LabelEncoder, and features are normalized.

## Data Split 🧩
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) with a random seed of 42.

## Models 🤖
The following models are evaluated:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
LightGBM
XGBoost

## Model Evaluation 📈
Model performance is assessed using:

- F1-score
- Area Under the Curve (AUC)

## Results 📊
Results for each model are displayed, including F1-score and AUC. 🚀
